## Set up for today’s challenge:

### CodeSandBox:

We are going to be using codesandbox.io: an online editor that can be used to create and deploy web applications. 
You can sign in to codesandbox.io using a github account. If you do not currently have one, you can create one here: Create a GitHub account
When you are logged in, to create a new Sandbox, go to the ‘+’ icon top right menu and select ‘React’.

### Challenge:

## Level 1:

Today we’ll try building a simple calculator using React using the following guide (please note there is no need to run create-react-app as we have already done that in CodeSandBox, which scaffolds a basic React app for us):

**If you would prefer not to participate in the challenge, you can chill with a coffee and read through the resource list at the end of this doc! There are some React exrecises you can try out here: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react For some React inspiration you can also check out these React app examples in CodeSandBox here: https://codesandbox.io/explore**


## Level 2:

Try building a Weather Map app - making a request to a weather API then displaying the right info for a city and country. See https://medium.com/@peterekeneeze/build-a-react-js-weather-app-with-stateless-functional-components-e61567004b54 for a Weather Map app tutorial. As we’re using CodeSandBox, you can ignore ‘Setting up React’ and start from the ‘App Component’ section.
